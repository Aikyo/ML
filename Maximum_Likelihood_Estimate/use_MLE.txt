Likelihood Function
    Likelihood describes the plausibility of a model parameter value, given specific observed data.

    Discrete probability distribution


Maximum likelihood estimation
    In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a
    statistical model, given observations. MLE attempts to find the parameter values that maximize the
    likelihood function, given the observations. The resulting estimate is called a maximum likelihood
    estimate, which is also abbreviated as MLE.
