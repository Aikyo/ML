Mathemetical model
    A mathemetical model is a description of a system using mathemetical concepts and language.The process of developing a mathemetical model is termed mathemetial modeling.Mathemetical models are used in the natural science such as physics,biology,earth science,chemistry and engineering disciplines such as computer science,electrical engineering,as well as the social science such as economics,psychology,sociology,plolitical science.
    A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects fo diffrent components,and to make predictions about the behaviour.
	
Regression Analysis
	In statistical modeling,regression analysis is a set of statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables.
	it includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables,when the focus  is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables 
	
	Regression analysis is widly used for predictions and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning. 


Linear regression
	In statistic,linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar responses(dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables or independent variables 
	
	The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.
	
	Linear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach, but they may also be fitted in other ways, such as by minimizing the "lack of fit" in some other norm (as with least absolute deviations regression), or by minimizing a penalized version of the least squares cost function as in ridge regression (L2-norm penalty) and lasso (L1-norm penalty). Conversely, the least squares approach can be used to fit models that are not linear models. Thus, although the terms "least squares" and "linear model" are closely linked, they are not synonymous.
